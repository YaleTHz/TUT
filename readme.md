**TUT** is a software package for extracting the refractive index/photoconductivity from time-domain THz (TDS) and time-resolved THz (TRTS) measurements.  It includes for processing samples with the following geometries:

1. Air/Sample
2. Air/Sample in Pressed Pellet
3. Air/Substrate/Sample
4. Air/Substrate/Sample/Substrate/Air
